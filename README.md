# meatspace

A somewhat unhealthy mod that turns everything into meat.
Features three biomes: skin with forests of hair, mucous membrane with towering teeth, and raw meat with icky stuff.

This mod will want to override the mapgen, so as an added safety measure you have to
enable custom mapgen in Settings -> Advanced settings -> Mods -> meatspace
